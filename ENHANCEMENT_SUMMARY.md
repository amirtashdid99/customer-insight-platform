## 🗄️ Database Schema Updates

### New Tables Added

1. **users**
   - id, email, hashed_password, full_name
   - is_active, is_admin
   - created_at, last_login

2. **notification_preferences**
   - id, user_id, product_id
   - email_alerts, sentiment_threshold
   - created_at, updated_at

3. **saved_products**
   - id, user_id, product_id
   - nickname, notes
   - created_at

All tables have proper foreign keys and indexes for performance.

## 📦 Dependencies Added

```bash
# Already had (no changes needed):
- passlib[bcrypt]  # Password hashing
- python-jose      # JWT tokens
- python-multipart # Form data

# New additions:
- pydantic[email]  # Email validation
```

---

## 🚀 Deployment Considerations

### Environment Variables to Add

```bash
# Authentication (Required)
SECRET_KEY=<32-char-random-string>
ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30

# Email Alerts (Optional - feature works without)
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=<app-password>
FRONTEND_URL=https://customer-insight-platform.vercel.app
```

### Render Deployment

Environment variables auto-set from `.env`. No additional configuration needed!

### Database Migration

Tables auto-create on first run (SQLAlchemy `Base.metadata.create_all()`).

For production, use Alembic:
```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add user auth and notifications"
alembic upgrade head
```

## 🧪 Testing the New Features

### Quick Test (No Email)

```bash
# 1. Start backend
cd backend
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# 2. Register user
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "testpass123",
    "full_name": "Test User"
  }'

# 3. Login (get token)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=test@example.com&password=testpass123"

# 4. Save product (use token from step 3)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/saved-products/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "product_name": "iPhone 15",
    "nickname": "My Product"
  }'

# 5. View saved products
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/saved-products/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-TOKEN>"
```

### With Email Alerts

Add to `.env`:
```bash
EMAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=<app-password>
```

Then enable alerts:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/notifications/preferences \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "product_name": "iPhone 15",
    "email_alerts": true,
    "sentiment_threshold": 0.2
  }'
```
