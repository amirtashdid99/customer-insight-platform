# ✅ Fixed: Redis Error 10061

## 🔴 The Error You Got:

```
Error: Error 10061 connecting to localhost:6379. 
No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it.
```

## ✅ What This Means:

**Redis is not installed or not running on your system.**

Redis is required for Full Mode (real web scraping), but NOT required for Demo Mode.

---

## 🎯 Solution 1: Use Demo Mode (Recommended)

**Easiest option - No Redis needed!**

```cmd
start-demo.bat
```

✅ Works instantly  
✅ No installation needed  
✅ Perfect for testing and demos  
✅ Uses mock data (~5 seconds)  

---

## 🎯 Solution 2: Install Redis (For Full Mode)

### Quick Install with Chocolatey:

**Step 1: Install Chocolatey** (if not already installed):
```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

**Step 2: Install Redis**:
```powershell
choco install redis-64 -y
```

**Step 3: Start Redis**:
```cmd
redis-server
```

**Step 4: Run Full Mode**:
```cmd
start-full.bat
```

### Manual Installation:

See **REDIS_SETUP.md** for complete installation guide with multiple methods.

---

## 🔧 What Changed in start-full.bat

The batch file now has **smart checks**:

### Before:
- ❌ Would try to run without checking Redis
- ❌ Confusing error messages
- ❌ Had to manually troubleshoot

### After:
- ✅ Checks if Redis is installed (stops if not)
- ✅ Checks if Redis is running (stops if not)
- ✅ Clear error messages with solutions
- ✅ Suggests Demo Mode as alternative

---

## 📋 Error Message Now Shows:

```
================================================
ERROR: Redis is NOT installed on your system!
================================================

You have 2 options:

Option 1: Install Redis (for Full Mode)
  - See REDIS_SETUP.md for installation guide
  - Quick: choco install redis-64

Option 2: Use Demo Mode instead (recommended)
  - Run: start-demo.bat
  - Works instantly, no Redis needed!

================================================
```

Or if Redis is installed but not running:

```
================================================
ERROR: Redis is NOT running!
================================================

Please start Redis in a new terminal first:
  redis-server

Then run this script again.

Alternatively, use Demo Mode:
  start-demo.bat

================================================
```

## 🧪 How to Test Redis

### Check if Redis is installed:
```cmd
where redis-server
```

### Start Redis:
```cmd
redis-server
```

### Test connection:
```cmd
redis-cli ping
```
Should respond: `PONG`

### Check if Redis is running:
```cmd
tasklist | findstr redis
```

## 💡 Recommendations

### For Development & Testing:
```cmd
start-demo.bat
```
- ✅ Instant start
- ✅ No dependencies
